                John Doe is dedicated to taking photos of the sky and all of its 
                components. He is a 28 year old photographer based in Iceland.
                Even though his base is in Iceland, he travels a lot from time to time
                to take pictures of lots of different phenomenons in the sky. 
                Even though he has been doing what he loves for over 15 years, he only
                does this professionally for 6 years.
            </p>

                John's passion is taking photographs of the stars, constellations and many other 
                phenomenons such as the Northern and Southern lights, thus he has to move all year
                round to capture those amazing moments. His talent has helped him to come a long
                way because he earned some awards for his exceptional work.
            </p>

                His work resides in many different museums and galleries of the world and also in 
                many households, as his photographs can be printed and hung on the walls. Many photographs 
                of his, have been published in magazines and social media, leading to much appreciation 
                for his art from many clients.
